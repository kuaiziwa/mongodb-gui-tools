# Feature Comparison for MongoDB GUI Tools

Here, we will continue to track and examine the following MongoDB GUI tools and compare their features. The products on the list are listed **alphabetically** as follows: [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass), [Navicat for MongoDB](https://navicat.com/en/products/navicat-for-mongodb), [NoSQLBooster](https://nosqlbooster.com), [NoSQLManager](https://www.mongodbmanager.com) and [Studio 3T](https://studio3t.com).

It is important to say that the feature set we have listed is incomplete, and even if both products implement the same feature, their implementation and usability are very different. In short, if you plan to choose a MongoDB GUI product, I suggest you download and try it to make sure it meets your needs.

## Why are there no "XXXX" products on this list?
Well, there are a lot of GUI tools for mongoDB, and those on our list need to have the following requirements.

- Must be a GUI specifically for MongoDB. MongoDB is a document database, which is very different from a relational database. Many products aimed at relational databases only regard mongoDB as another database compatible with ODBC or JDBC, which is not applicable.
- Must be active maintenance products, those that have been officially abandoned or have not been updated for more than a year are not listed here.
- Must be a downloadable application, which excludes all SaaS products.
- Must have a feature set that meets the pass line, which can be referred to the product with the least features on our list.
